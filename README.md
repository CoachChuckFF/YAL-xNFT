# YAL xNFT

This is the xNFT version of my perma-dApp YAL ( You are Loved ) Quickly put together directly after the Backpack xNFT presentation at Breakpoint '22. ( Literally, I ran back to the hostel after the presentation! )

The full dApp site, stored forever and always with SHDW Drive is [here](https://shdw-drive.genesysgo.net/6P6WznKbJ2nEMCfrXZDQvipCgCSx45SXxjWMWvqfPtyJ/yal_website.html)

Just like the perma dApp this will always be open source! Feel free to reach out and ask any questions you may have [@CoachChuckFF](https://twitter.com/CoachChuckFF)

## Developing

Once you've installed Backpack, get started building your xNFT with these steps. Note that the packages here will always use the latest, which correspond to the latest tagged build of Backpack. If you have unexepected issues, make sure your package versions match the app version.

### Install

First, install dependencies.

```
yarn
```

### Run the dev server

Then, run the dev server with hot reloading

```
yarn dev
```

### Open the Simulator in Backpack

Now that you have your xNFT dev server running, open it in the Backpack simulator to see it run.

That's it!
